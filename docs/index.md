## Welcome to ASA Stat 101. 

This page contains links and other student-facing information for StatPREP activities.

## Tutorials

Tutorials are interactive web documents that instructors can use as in-class activities or as assignments. Chances are, your instructor has his or her own web site that contains links to the Tutorials being used in your class. But your welcome to browse this site to look at Tutorials that were not assigned.
